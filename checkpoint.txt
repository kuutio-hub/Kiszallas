Checkpoint: v2.11.0 - PDF Export Simplification and Stability

This version represents a major stabilization point and architectural shift for document generation.

Főbb pontok:
- **PDF Export Simplification:** The PDF export feature was radically simplified to a single "Print / Save PDF" button. This removes external libraries and relies on the browser's stable, built-in printing functionality, ensuring cross-platform consistency and reliability.
- **Documentation Restoration:** Critical documentation files (`LOGIC.md`, `checkpoint.txt`) were restored to the project, ensuring that the core business logic and project milestones are properly documented.
- **Code Cleanup:** The unused `html2pdf.js` library was removed, resulting in a lighter and cleaner codebase.
